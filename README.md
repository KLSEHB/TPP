 **TPP: A Temporal-Enhanced Propagation Probability Model for Identifying Influential Nodes in Complex Networks**


This repository contains the implementation and experimental results of **TPP**, a model that integrates propagation-based mechanisms with deep learning techniques to identify influential nodes in complex networks.  
The proposed approach leverages the strengths of both paradigms: propagation models capture diffusion dynamics, while deep learning models uncover latent structural features and improve generalization across diverse networks.
