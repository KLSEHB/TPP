 **TPP: A Temporal-Enhanced Propagation Probability Model for Identifying Influential Nodes in Complex Networks**

Networks: Raw graph datasets (real-world + training networks)
SIR_results: Epidemic "fingerprints" (SIR simulation outputs, used as labels)
results: All model outputs (detailed experiment results)
main / getSirLabel / Test: Core workflow (train → generate labels → evaluate)
DirectedG.py: Same logic, but for directed graphs (with edge direction)
